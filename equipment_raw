        Aluminum Foil

*Description *

  * Aluminum foil is a thin pliable sheet of aluminum sold on a roll or
    by the sheet.
  * Aluminum foil is used to cover or wrap foods. Aluminum foil is a
    good heat and cold barrier.
  * It is available in regular, heavy-duty, non-stick and in two sizes,
    regular and extra wide

*Substitutions*

  * When covering food before freezing it, use plastic resealable
    freezer bags or food storage containers. Plastic food bags or food
    wrap can be used to cover a food before refrigerating it.

*Tips*

  * Use aluminum foil to line baking pans and to wrap food for freezing.
  * Do not use aluminum foil to cover or wrap acidic foods, such as
    tomatoes, because the acid will pit the foil.
  * Generally, aluminum foil should not be used in the microwave oven.


        Baking Dishes

*Description*

  * Baking dishes or casseroles are square, oblong or rectangular dishes
    made of glass, ceramic or other materials. They are used to bake
    lasagna, casseroles, etc. They are often decorative and colorful and
    are designed to go from oven to table. Many casseroles are freezer
    and dishwasher safe. Some come with lids.
  * Common sizes are 1, 2, 2 ½ quart and 3 quart dishes. Some are much
    larger.
  * The term “baking dish” most often refers to a square or rectangular
    8 or 9-inch, 12x8-inch or 13x9-inch oven-proof glass dish, although
    other sizes are available. While they are often used for baking
    cakes and brownies, lasagna, meatloaf, and casseroles are often
    baked in baking dishes. They tend to be plain glass without a design.
  * A lasagna pan is a ceramic or enamel pan sold to bake and serve
    lasagna. They often have handles for easy removal from the oven.
    Most are 13x9-inches or slightly larger.

*Substitutions*

  * Either a baking dish or casserole can be used if the size is
    adequate for the recipe.
  * Metal 8, 9 or 13x9-inch pans could also be used, although acidic
    dishes, such as tomatoes in lasagna, may discolor aluminum pans.

*Tips*

  * Attractive casseroles that can go right to the table save on clean-up.
  * Casseroles became popular with the “one dish meal” which typically
    consists of meat, starch and vegetable all combined with a sauce or
    soup.


        Baking Sheet

*Description*

  * A flat, rigid, metal sheet, made of aluminum used for baking and
    cooking. It can also be used as a drip pan beneath items being
    cooked or baked.
  * The flat edges let you easily slide appetizers or other items off
    the baking sheet.
  * Insulated baking sheets sandwich air between two metal layers,
    protecting from overbrowning of the baked product. Generally, baking
    time needs to be increased if using insulated baking sheets.
  * Common sizes for baking sheets are: 17x14-inch, 12x15-inch

*Substitutions*

  * Turn a jelly-roll pan (15 x 10 x 1-inch pan) upside-down and use it
    in place of a baking sheet.

*Tips*

  * We recommend shiny aluminum baking sheets without sides for best
    results.
  * Allow baking sheet to cool completely before re-using.
  * Bake only one sheet of cookies at a time on the middle rack in the
    center of the oven.
  * Baked products will brown more quickly on dark-colored baking sheets
    because they absorb more heat than shiny baking sheets.
  * Line baking sheet with parchment paper. The paper will withstand
    high temperatures without discoloring or scorching. The baking sheet
    is also easier to clean.
  * Follow recipe directions for greasing or spraying the baking sheet
    with no-stick cooking spray.


        Baking/Cookie Sheet

*Description*

  * A flat, rigid, metal sheet, made of aluminum used for baking cookies
    and biscuits.
  * Insulated baking sheets sandwich air between two metal layers,
    protecting from overbrowning of the baked product. Generally, baking
    time needs to be increased if using insulated baking sheets.
  * Common sizes for baking sheets are:
      o 17x14-inch
      o 12x15-inch

*Substitutions*

  * Turn a jelly-roll pan (15 x 10 x 1-inch pan) upside-down and use it
    in place of a baking sheet.

*Tips*

  * We recommend shiny aluminum baking sheets without sides for best
    results.
  * Allow baking sheet to cool completely before reusing.
  * Bake only one sheet of cookies at a time on the middle rack in the
    center of the oven.
  * Baked products will brown more quickly on dark-colored baking
    sheets, because they absorb more heat than shiny baking sheets.
  * Line baking sheet with parchment paper. The paper will withstand
    high temperatures without discoloring or scorching. The baking sheet
    is also easier to clean. After baking cookies on parchment, you can
    slide the sheet of parchment with the baked cookies onto the rack
    for cooling.
  * Follow recipe directions for greasing or spraying the baking sheet
    with no stick cooking spray.


        Baster

*Description*

  * A baster, also called a bulb baster, is a hollow metal, plastic or
    glass tube with a squeezable bulb at the end. A baster is often used
    to remove fat or liquid from the bottom of a pan of roasting meat or
    poultry. Squeeze the bulb to push the air out and then release
    to remove off the fat or liquid. The fat or liquid can then be
    released and used to baste the roasting meat, saved for gravy or
    discarded. Some basters come with a cleaning brush. The bulb is
    removed for cleaning the baster.

*Substitutions*

  * A ladle or large spoon can be used to remove fat or to baste.

*Tips*

  * When purchasing a new baster check that it is heat resistant at high
    temperatures.
  * A baster can be used to apply a marinade to meat or vegetables.


        Blender

*Description*

  * A blender is a countertop electric kitchen appliance that can be
    used for blending drinks, pureeing vegetables, mixing and
    emulsifying soft foods, dressings, etc.
  * A glass, stainless steel or plastic container with blades at the
    bottom is mounted on a base containing an electric motor. The blades
    rotate to chop or blend. A tight-fitting lid keeps the food from
    escaping as it is processed. Some blenders have up to 10 different
    speeds.
  * Depending on the brand, the container can hold 6 to 10 cups.
  * Some blenders can be used to crush ice.

*Substitutions*

  * Depending on what task needs to be accomplished, a mini food
    chopper, a food processor, a juicer or a cutting board and knife can
    be substituted.
  * To blend drinks an immersion blender can be used.

*Tips*

  * Read the manual.
  * Turn off the blender before removing the lid.
  * Choose a blender with 500 watts or more.
  * Use to make smoothies and frozen drinks.
  * No air is incorporated during the processing, so egg whites or
    whipping cream cannot be whipped.


        Bread Pan

*Description*

  * A rectangular baking pan, sometimes referred to as a loaf pan.
  * Standard sizes for bread pans:
      o 8 ½ x 4 ¼ x 3 1/8-inch holds 5 cups
      o 9 x 5 x 3-inch holds 8 cups
      o 5 ½ x 3 x 2 ½-inch holds 2 cups
  * Bread pans may be made from aluminum, stainless steel or glass.

*Substitutions*

  * When you don't have the right size bread pan substitute a pan with
    similar capacity. Fill the pan ½ full but never more than 2/3 full
    so the bread has room to rise. The baking time may need to be changed.
  * If substituting mini loaf pans in place of a larger bread pan, fill
    each mini loaf pan ½ full. Decrease baking time by ½ and check at
    that point for doneness. Continue baking, if necessary, checking
    doneness every five minutes.

*Tips*

  * To determine pan size, measure length and width of the pan across
    the top inside. Measure height from the inside of the pan, holding a
    ruler straight up from the bottom.
  * To prevent a loaf from sticking, always follow the recipe directions
    for greasing or spraying the pan with no stick cooking spray.


        Broiler Pan

*Description*

  * A broiler pan is a large piece of kitchen equipment that usually
    comes with the purchase of a stove but can also be purchased
    separately. It consists of two pieces: a rectangular or square pan
    and a slotted lid with ridges which fits over the bottom pan. Meat
    is placed on the slotted lid; during broiling the juices and fat go
    through the slots into the bottom pan. Food is broiled under a gas
    or electric heat source.

*Substitutions*

  * Depending on the food to be broiled, a cookie or pizza pan could be
    used.
  * Most toaster ovens can broil food.
  * Do not broil in a glass pan.

*Tips*

  * Read the oven manual. With electric ovens the oven door must remain
    slightly ajar.
  * Watch food that is broiling so it doesn't burn. Most recipe
    directions suggest broiling 5 inches from the heat source.
  * Lining the bottom of the pan with aluminum foil will help with cleanup.
  * Use the bottom pan to roast vegetables.
  * Try the broiler pan to toast buns or bread, melt cheese on
    sandwiches or broil fish.


        Cake Pan

*Description*

  * Cake pans may be made from aluminum, stainless steel or glass.
  * Common sizes for cake pans are:
      o 8 x 8 x 1 ½-inch square holds 6 cups
      o 9 x 1 ½-inch round holds 6 cups
      o 13 x 9 x 2-inch holds 15 cups
      o 11 x 7 x 2-inch holds 6 cups
      o 10 x 4-inch tube pan holds 16 cups
      o 10 x 3 ½-inch Bundt® pan holds 12 cups

*Substitutions*

  * When you don’t have the right size cake pan substitute a cake pan
    with a similar capacity. Fill the pan ½ full but not more than 2/3
    full so the cake has room to rise. Vary the baking time if needed.

*Tips*

  * An 8-inch square pan holds 1 cup more batter than an 8-inch round
    pan. Usually square pans are 2 inches deep and round pans are 1 1/2
    inches deep, therefore, a square pan will hold more.
  * Dark-colored and glass bakeware absorbs more heat than shiny
    bakeware, therefore a. baked product will brown more quickly in
    these pans.
  * Follow recipe directions for greasing or spraying the baking pan
    with no stick cooking spray.
  * Do /not/ grease a tube pan before baking an angel food cake or
    sponge cake. The batter needs to cling to the side of the pan as the
    cake rises during baking -- greasing the pan prevents the batter
    from sticking to the surface of the pan and the cake will not be
    light and airy.


        Can Opener

*Description*

  * A can opener is a manual kitchen tool or an electric small
    appliance. A sharp circular blade rotates and cuts around the lid of
    metal cans. Electric can openers have a magnet which holds the cut
    lid away from the can.
  * There are many types of openers:
      o A bottle opener is used to pry off the lid of a bottle or jar.
      o A puncture type opener punctures the lid of a can.
      o A corkscrew is used to open wine bottles.

*Substitution*

  * If you are opening cans without a pop top lid, you will need either
    an electric or manual can opener. Today many bottles and cans can be
    screwed off or popped open, so many small types of openers aren’t as
    common.

*Tips*

  * Read the manual for electric can openers.
  * Some models of electric can openers are tall and are good for
    opening tall juice cans.
  * Be sure and keep the blade clean by frequently washing in sudsy, hot
    water.
  * An electric can opener in a power outage is useless.


        Candy Thermometer

*Description*

  * A candy thermometer is used to test the temperature during the
    cooking of candy, jams and jellies. A candy thermometer often has an
    adjustable clip so that it can rest against the sides of a heavy-
    gauge saucepan.

*Substitutions*

  * Use the cold water temperature test if you do not have a candy
    thermometer. Drop a small amount of the butter toffee mixture into a
    cup of very cold water. Carefully remove the cooled mixture with
    your fingers. Test for the desired candy stage according to the
    following guidelines:
      o /Soft Ball Stage/ -- Syrup forms a soft ball in the water but
        flattens when removed from the water (234° -240° F) (110° -115°
        C). Used for fudge, penuche and fondants.
      o /Firm Ball Stage/ -- Syrup forms a firm ball that holds it shape
        when removed from the water (242° -248° F) (115° -120° C). Used
        for soft caramels.
      o /Hard Ball Stage/ -- Mixture can be rolled into a firm ball
        (250° -260° F) (120° -130° C). Used for divinity and nougats.
      o /Soft Crack Stage /-- Syrup separates into threads which are
        hard but not brittle (270° -284° F) (130° - 145° C). Used for
        butterscotch and hard candies.
      o /Hard Crack Stage/ -- Syrup separates into threads that are hard
        and brittle (300° -310° F) (150° -155° C). Used for nut brittles
        and toffee.

*Tips*

  * Test candy thermometer for accuracy before using. Place bulb of
    candy thermometer in a pan of rapidly boiling water. Be careful not
    to let the bulb touch the bottom of the pan. Read the temperature at
    eye level while the thermometer is in the water. It should read 212°
    F or 100° C.
  * If the thermometer does not measure boiling temperature correctly,
    remember to adjust the candy temperature during cooking to reflect
    the difference.


        Carving Set

*Description*

  * A carving set is often given as a gift to a bridal couple! It
    consists of a boxed set that includes a meat fork and a carving
    knife. The meat fork is used to stabilize the meat while it is
    carved with the carving knife.

*Substitutions*

  * A generic heavy meat fork and carving knife can be purchased separately.

*Tip*

  * Skip the set and buy a good carving knife.


        Casserole

*Description*

  * A casseroles is a square, oblong or rectangular dish made of glass,
    ceramic or other materials. It can be used to bake a main dish
    recipe or lasagna. Casseroles are often decorative and colorful and
    are designed to go from oven to table. Many casseroles are freezer
    and dishwasher safe. Some come with lids.
  * Common sizes are 1, 2, 2 ½-quart and 3-quart dishes. Some are much
    larger.
  * In recipes the term “baking dish” sometimes refers to a square or
    rectangular 8 or 9-inch, 12x8-inch or 13x9-inch oven-proof glass
    dish, although other sizes are available.
  * A lasagna pan is a ceramic or enamel pan sold to bake and serve
    lasagna. It often has handles for easy removal from the oven. Most
    are 13x9-inches or slightly larger.

*Substitutions*

  * Metal 8, 9 or 13x9-inch pans can also be used, although acidic
    dishes, such as tomatoes in lasagna, may discolor aluminum pans.


        Cheese Slicer

*Description*

  * A cheese slicer is a kitchen tool for slicing cheese. It is most
    often metal and has an adjustable wire or blade at the end that can
    cut cheese in thin or thick slices.
  * A cheese plane is a kitchen tool used to cut soft cheeses. It
    usually has a metal or wooden handle with a flat, triangular blade
    at the bottom with a large slot through it.

*Substitutions*

  * A sharp knife and a cutting board can be used for the cheese slicer
    or plane.


        Cheesecloth

*Description*

  * Cheesecloth is a gauze-like cotton cloth which can be used to strain
    foods. It doesn’t fall apart and imparts no flavor. Herbs or spices
    can be tied up in a square packet of cheesecloth and placed into
    canning syrup, soups or stews. Just remove the bag when you are
    through cooking.

*Substitutions*

  * A tea ball for spices can be used. A fine meshed sieve can be used
    for straining liquids.

*Tip*

  * Line a colander with cheesecloth for straining out fine unwanted
    particles or cloves in a canning liquid.


        Colander

*Description*

  * A colander is a plastic or metal bowl that is perforated with many
    small to medium holes. It usually has one or two handles for
    gripping and feet or a rimmed bottom. A colander is used to drain
    cooked food, canned vegetables or fruit and pasta. A colander can be
    used to rinse fresh vegetables and fruit. The liquid or water runs
    through the holes and the food stays in the bowl.

*Substitution*

  * A large strainer or sieve can be substituted.


        Convection Oven

*Description*

  * Both conventional and convection ovens use air heated by a gas or
    electric burner. The main difference is that a convection oven has a
    fan generally at the back of the oven that circulates the heat.
  * A convection oven continuously circulates hot air with a fan through
    the oven cavity. The accelerated effect of the circulating air is
    one reason for the superior results you get when baking in a
    convection oven. For example, the butter in a pie crust releases its
    steam quickly, creating flaky layers.
  * Hot air circulating throughout the oven eliminates hot and cold
    spots for more even baking and cooking.

*Tips*

  * Experiment with your favorite recipes by reducing the oven
    temperature by 25° F. and adjusting the baking time. Food baked in a
    convection oven is done about 25% faster than in a conventional oven
  * Preheat the oven prior to convection baking as you would also do if
    using a conventional oven. The oven temperature should reach the
    correct baking temperature prior to baking.
  * Allow at least 1 inch between the pans and also between the edges of
    the pan and the oven walls. This space is needed so the air is
    circulated evenly in the oven.
  * It is best to keep the oven door closed as much as possible during
    the baking time so that airflow is maintained.


        Cookie Cutter

*Description*

  * A cookie cutter is used to cut decorative shapes from dough that has
    been rolled out.
  * Cookie cutters are made from aluminum, copper or plastic. Common
    sizes are 2-inch to 3-inch, however cutters are available in 1/2-
    inch up to 12-inches.

*Substitutions*

  * A drinking glass may be used as a substitute for a round cookie cutter.
  * To make your own cookie cutter shape, cut a template from cardboard
    or paper. Place the template over the rolled out cookie dough;
    carefully cut around design with a sharp knife.

*Tip*

  * Dip cookie cutter into flour to prevent cutter from sticking to the
    dough.


        Cooling Rack

*Description*

  * A cooling rack is a rack made from closely spaced wires or spokes,
    and small legs that elevate the rack above the countertop.
  * Cooling racks are often metal, however can be made from wood or
    other heatproof material.
  * The rack speeds the cooling of cookies, cakes or breads. It allows
    steam to escape from all sides of the baked product so the bottom
    doesn't get soggy.

*Substitutions*

  * Cool cookies on parchment on the countertop rather than on a cooling
    rack. As cookies begin to cool turn them over to speed complete
    cooling and prevent bottom of cookies from getting soggy.

*Tips*

  * When baking cookies use a cooling rack with closely spaced wires or
    spokes so cookies have adequate support when cooling.
  * Cover the rack with a sheet of waxed paper before placing a delicate
    cake on the rack to prevent the surface from getting damaged or
    sticking to the rack.


        Corer

*Description*

  * An apple corer is a kitchen tool that removes the core, or the
    center of an apple, which contains the seeds. The rest of the apple
    is left whole.
  * Apple wedgers or slicers are wheel-shaped with a hole in the center.
    The apple is cored and cut into wedges in one step.
  * A pineapple corer is also available. The core is removed and the
    pineapple is cut into rings.

*Substitutions*

  * Sharp paring knife can be used.

*Tips*

  * Always place the apple on a cutting board before using the apple
    corer. This will protect the countertop.
  * An apple corer can also be used on fresh pears.


        Custard Cup

*Description*

  * A custard cup is an ovenproof glass or ceramic dish which hold about
    6-ounces. Custard cups were originally used for baking custard.

*Substitutions*

  * For baking, ramekins (small soufflé dishes) could be used.
  * For some foods a muffin pan might be used.

*Tips*

  * Custard cups are ideal to hold small amounts of ingredients such as
    minced garlic and chopped herbs when preparing a recipe.
  * No popover pan? Use custard cups.
  * Use to melt butter or chocolate in the microwave.
  * Use as a substitute cookie cutter; turn the custard cup upside down
    and cut out rounds of cookies or biscuits from dough.


        Cutting Board

*Description*

  * A cutting board is a durable flat surface used to cut food on. Most
    are usable on both sides. Cutting boards can be made out of wood,
    plastic, sustainable materials like bamboo or specialized glass.
    Flexible cutting boards made of plastic or silicone are now readily
    available. You can fold both edges of the flexible boards to the
    middle and create a funnel, sliding the prepared food into a bowl,
    pan or skillet.
  * A carving board would have a groove around all edges, or down the
    middle for meat juices to flow into. This helps avoid a mess when
    carving meat.

*Tips*

  * Food safety is critical with cutting boards. Do not cut vegetables
    or fruit on a cutting board which was used to cut meat. Some cooks
    use color coded cutting boards, using red for meat, green for
    vegetables and blue for seafood.
  * Knife cuts in wooden cutting boards are hard to clean. Wood is
    porous and bacteria can grow in these cuts and on the board. Soak
    wooden cutting boards in a solution of 1 tablespoon bleach to a
    gallon of water for 2 minutes, then wash in hot, sudsy water.
  * New plastic or silicone cutting boards can be washed in the dishwasher.


        Deep Fat Fryer

*Description*

  * A deep fat fryer is an electric countertop cooking appliance for
    deep fat frying foods. It may contain a perforated wire basket which
    can be used during frying. The basket makes it easier to remove the
    fried food from the hot oil and drain off excess oil. A deep fat
    fryer also has temperature controls to help maintain a constant
    temperature. Deep fat fryers are available in various sizes.

*Substitution*

  * A deep pot and a deep fat thermometer.

*Tips*

  * Read the manual.
  * Follow recipe directions for the required oil temperature.
  * Make sure the oil used has a high smoke point, meaning it can be
    heated to a high temperature without smoking.  
  * Oil must be hot or food will be greasy or burned. Most fried foods
    should have a crisp crust and a moist interior.
  * Oil can sometimes be re-used if cooled and strained to remove any
    solids. Use the strained oil to cook the same type of food. 
  * Add food gradually to avoid spatters and burns.


        Double Boiler

*Description*

  * A double boiler is actually three pieces of glass or stainless steel
    pans sold together and used on the stovetop. The bottom pan is used
    to hold simmering water. The second, and smaller pan, sets inside
    the bottom pan and holds the food to be cooked. A lid is the third
    piece.
  * Sauces, custards and puddings can be cooked this way. The food does
    not need to be constantly stirred while it is cooking.

*Substitution*

  * A heavy pan or an ovenproof glass bowl can be placed in a skillet
    containing 1/2-inch of simmering water.

*Tips*

  *

    Use to melt large quantities of chocolate and keep it at a constant
    temperature for dipping candy, strawberries or pretzels.

  *

    Cook polenta and grits in a double boiler.  


        Dutch Oven

*Description*

  * A Dutch oven is a large, heavy-bottomed, oven-safe pot with a tight-
    fitting lid used to braise meat, cook pasta or make soups and stews.
    It is good for moist cooking methods. A Dutch oven can go from
    stovetop to the oven. Most common sizes are 3 1/2-quart to 8-quart.
    Some are made of cast iron with enamel coatings.

*Substitutions*

  * Substitute a heavy pot with a tight-fitting lid.
  * A stock pot might work.

*Tips*

  * Make a pot of chili in a Dutch oven.
  * Brown meat in the Dutch oven on the stovetop and then the pan can go
    in the oven.


        Egg Beater

*Description*

  * An egg beater is a hand-held kitchen tool with two beaters. It is
    used to beat eggs, whipping cream or egg whites, as well as mix
    batters, like pancakes.

*Substitutions*

  * Wire whisks, hand or stand mixers can do the job of an egg beater.

*Tips*

  * An egg beater incorporates air during the beating which a blender
    wouldn’t, so use a mixer or egg beater for beating egg whites or
    whipping cream.


        Egg Separator

*Description*

  * An egg separator is a plastic or metal kitchen tool used to separate
    the white from the egg yolk. When using this utensil the egg white
    falls through the opening and the yolk stays whole in the top.

*Substitution*

  * Learn to crack and separate an egg in a dish by gently wrapping the
    side of the egg to crack it. Gradually transfer the white of the egg
    to one side of the shell leaving the yolk on the other side.

*Tip*

  * Crack each egg into a separate bowl before adding it to other
    ingredients. If the egg is spoiled or tiny shell pieces need to be
    removed, you won’t have a problem.


        Egg Slicer

*Description*

  * An egg slicer is a metal or plastic tool for slicing hard cooked
    eggs. The egg is place on the oval side of the hinged slicer and the
    thin wires on the other side cut the egg into even slices as it is
    pressed over the egg.

*Substitution*

  * Cut the egg with a knife

*Tips*

  * To make chopped egg for egg salad or potato salad, after the first
    cut, rotate the direction of the egg and cut through with the wires
    again.
  * Slice mushrooms with the egg slicer.


        Electric Mixer

*Description*

  * An electric mixer is a kitchen appliance used to beat, mix or whip
    batter.
  * Electric mixers can be small and portable for small jobs or larger
    and more powerful for more difficult jobs. Many of the more powerful
    stand mixers have special attachments such as dough hooks or paddle
    beaters.

*Substitutions*

  * Mixtures may be creamed, mixed or beaten by hand using a wooden
    spoon or whisk. It may be more difficult to create the same
    consistency by hand as with an electric mixer.
  * A large food processor can be used for some baking recipes instead
    of a mixer. Be careful to process ingredients just until mixed.
  * We do not recommend mixing ingredients for a baking recipe in a
    blender. The batter is generally thick and the shape of the blender
    container is not designed to mix these batters.

*Tips*

  * Be sure beaters are clean before beating egg whites. Any fat, even a
    drop of egg yolk, on the beaters can prevent the whites from
    reaching optimum volume.
  * Whipping cream will be faster if the bowl and beaters are chilled at
    least 15 minutes before beating.
  * The action of the beaters in mixing will tend to warm the butter in
    a cookie dough and help to soften it.

*Substitutions*

  * Substitute a 13x9 inch baking pan in a recipe for a 15x10x1 inch
    jelly-roll pan. The baked product will be thicker than the original
    recipe. Bake time will be longer than stated in the recipe. Check
    for doneness at half the original baking time. Continue baking until
    baked product tests done.

*Tips*

  * Follow recipe directions for greasing or spraying the pan with no
    stick cooking spray.
  * To make cake removal easier, line bottom of jelly-roll pan with
    waxed paper or parchment paper. Grease the paper on one side so it
    will adhere to the baking pan and on the other side to make baked
    product easy to remove from pan.


        Juicer

*Description*

  * A juicer is a kitchen hand tool, often made of glass or stainless
    steel that is used to squeeze juice from a half of a citrus fruit,
    like lemon. The juice is squeezed from the fruit by turning it
    against the cone-shaped center of the tool.
  * Hand-held reamers work the same way but are held over a bowl to
    catch juice.
  * The citrus press presses the juice out of cut fruit. The pulp and
    seeds stay in the top of the squeezer and the juice flows through
    the holes at the base of the squeezer into a cup or bowl. 
  * A tabletop electric juicer operates in the same way, except the food
    to be juiced is placed into a container and the fruit is rotated and
    quickly squeezed. The juice goes into the bottom container. Some
    juicers are very elaborate and can juice hard vegetables like
    carrots. Some have spigots to drain off a glass of juice.

    than cutting paper and fabric.


        Kitchen Timer

*Description*

  * A kitchen timer is used to help accurately keep track of the baking
    time.
  * Electronic timers digitally display the time remaining. Clock-like
    timers have markings around the outside like a clock so you can
    easily read how much time is remaining.
  * Most ovens have built-in timers.

*Tip*

  * Prevent over-baking by setting the timer for the minimum baking time
    in a recipe. Test for doneness and continue baking, if necessary.

      o 5 ½ x 3 x 2 ½-inch holds 2 cups
  * Bread pans may be made from aluminum, stainless steel or glass.

*Substitutions*

  * When you don't have the right size bread pan, substitute a pan with
    similar capacity. Fill the pan ½ full but never more than 2/3 full
    so the bread has room to rise. The baking time may need to be changed.
  * If substituting mini loaf pans in place of a larger bread pan, fill
    each mini loaf pan ½ full. Decrease baking time by ½ and check at
    that point for doneness. Continue baking, if necessary, checking
    doneness every five minutes.

*Tips*

  * To determine pan size, measure length and width of the pan across
    the top inside. Measure height from the inside of the pan, holding a
    ruler straight up from the bottom.
  * To prevent a loaf from sticking, always follow the recipe directions
    for greasing or spraying the pan with no-stick cooking spray.
  * Bread or loaf pans can be used for baking meatloaf.

      o For measuring dry ingredients: These measuring cups are made of
        metal or plastic, sometimes nested together, and come in sets of
        1/8-cup to 2-cup sizes
      o For measuring liquid ingredients: These cups, made of glass or
        plastic, come in 1 to 8-cup sizes. Measures are marked on the
        side and cup has a spout for pouring the measured ingredients.

*Tips*

  * Use the proper measuring cups for dry and liquid ingredients. Do not
    substitute liquid and dry measuring cups for one another.
  * A large glass measuring cup, such as a 4-cup or 8-cup size, is a
    great mixing bowl especially for thinner mixtures that can be poured.


        Measuring Spoon

*Description*

  * Measuring spoons come in sets of 1/8 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon. They
    can be made of metal or plastic.

*Tips*

  * It is important to measure accurately particularly in baking since
    the ratio of dry to wet ingredients is very important. However in
    some recipes you may note some measuring terms handed down through
    generations. As a guideline these measures should equal:
  * 1 heaping teaspoon = 1 ¾ to 2 teaspoons
  * 1 heaping tablespoon = 1 ½ to 2 tablespoons
  * 1 rounded teaspoon, tablespoon = measure ingredient so it is
    slightly rounded over rim of measure
  * 1 dash = 1/16 teaspoon
  * Never measure ingredients over the bowl or pan you are adding to. It
    is very easy to overflow the measuring spoon as you pour into it.
  * Buy several sets of measuring spoons to be sure you always have
    clean spoons available.
  * Tableware spoons should not be used for measuring since they vary in
    size.


        Meat Fork

*Description*

  * A meat fork is a kitchen tool that is a heavy-duty fork, with two or
    three sturdy tines on a long handle. It is used to hold meat or

    tenderizer or pounder. It is used to tenderize meat by flattening
    and breaking the surface fibers. It can have a hammer-like or round
    shape. Most have two sides, a flat one for pounding and a waffled,
    ridge-shaped side for tenderizing meat.

*Substitutions*

  * The edge of a plate can be used to pound the surface of meat. Some
    potato mashers would also work.

*Tips*

  * Sturdy construction and rust resistance are two factors to look for.


        Melon Baller

*Description*

  * A melon baller is a kitchen tool used to shape melon into
    balls. Most have a rounded or oval “spoon” at the end of a
    handle. Some melon ballers have 2 sizes of spoons, one at each end.

    or larger more powerful stand mixers for more difficult jobs. Many
    of the more powerful stand mixers have special attachments such as
    dough hooks or paddle beaters.

*Substitutions*

  * Mixtures may be creamed, mixed or beaten by hand using a wooden
    spoon or whisk. It may be more difficult to create the same
    consistency by hand as with an electric mixer.
  * A large food processor can be used for some recipes instead of a
    mixer. Be careful to process ingredients just until mixed.

*Tips*

  * Be sure beaters are clean before beating egg whites. Any fat, even a
    drop of egg yolk, on the beaters can prevent the whites from
    reaching optimum volume.
  * Whipping cream will be faster if the bowl and beaters are chilled at
    least 15 minutes before beating.  


        Mixing Bowl

*Description*

  * A mixing bowl is used to hold ingredients you are mixing, beating or
    whipping.

      o Muffin-top cup is about 4 inches in diameter but are only 1/2
        inch deep.

*Substitutions*

  * Substitute another size muffin cup for original size listed in
    recipe. If substituting a larger size muffin cup the recipe will
    yield fewer muffins and if using smaller size muffin cup the recipe
    will yield more muffins. The bake time will be changed also. Bake a
    larger muffin longer than the original time and smaller muffins a
    shorter time.

*Tips*

  * Grease muffin cups by spraying each cup with no stick cooking spray
    or using a paper towel dipped in shortening to grease each cup.
  * For rounded tops on muffins grease only the bottom of the cup and
    halfway up the side of the cup.
  * Use paper liners in muffin cups for easy clean-up.
  * If muffin cups are filled more than ¾ full the muffins will have
    flat, “flying saucer” tops. If sufficient room is not allowed for
    muffins to expand before reaching the top of the cup the muffin will
    flatten on top.
  * If some muffin cups will remain empty during baking, put 2 to 3
    tablespoons water in the unused muffin cups to keep the pan from
    warping.
  * If baked muffins stick to the bottom of the muffin cup, place hot
    muffin pan on a wet towel for about two minutes.

  * Rubber scrapers, pancake turners and frosting spreaders are all
    generically called spatulas.

*Tips*

  * Use a plastic turner on a non-stick baking pan or sheet.
  * Using a turner with holes or slots allows liquids or fats to drain
    off the item being lifted.
  * Pancake turners are great for turning flaky fish fillets. 


        Panini Grill

*Description*

  * A Panini grill is a specialized countertop electric kitchen
    appliance used to create a pressed, grilled sandwich called a Panini. 
  * This hinged appliance has a top and bottom with ridges.  Both sides
    heat.  A sandwich is placed on the bottom and the top is slowly
    lowered.  As it cooks, the top lowers and compresses the sandwich. 
    The end result is a golden sandwich with grid marks, cooked on both
    sides at the same time.

*Substitutions*

  * A stovetop electric grill will work.
  * You won’t get grill marks, but any type of griddle or skillet will
    grill a sandwich.  To compress the sandwich use a grill press.

*Tips*

  * Nonstick surface makes for quick clean-up.
  * A small amount of butter or a quick spray of cooking oil on the
    bread is all that is needed to give a golden surface to the bread.

  * Silicone mats are becoming popular replacements for some uses.

*Tips*

  * Line cake pans for easy removal of cake layers. Lay the cake pan,
    bottom side down, on the parchment paper. Trace around it. Cut the
    paper, grease the pan, and line the greased pan with the parchment
    paper.
  * Lining cookie sheets with parchment paper helps with cleanup. If
    decorating cookies with sprinkles or sugar before baking, the excess
    sugar can be shaken off the parchment paper and reused for the next
    pan of cookies.


        Pastry Bag

    plastic food storage bag. Fill and squeeze food through opening.
  * Buy frosting in tubes and cans in the baking section for decorating
    cakes and cookies.

*Tip*

  * Disposable pastry bags are sold on rolls.


        Pastry Blender

*Description*

  * A pastry blender is made of five or six parallel U-shaped steel
    wires attached at both ends to a handle.
  * A pastry blender is used to cut cold butter into a flour mixture to
    distribute the fat without melting it such as in making pie crusts
    or biscuits.

*Substitutions*

  * Two knives held together at an angle may be substituted for a pastry
    blender. Use the knives to cut the fat into the dry ingredients
    until the pieces of flour-coated fat become smaller and have the
    texture of coarse crumbs. A fork may also be used instead of two knives.

*Tips*

  * Be sure the butter is cold when cutting it into the flour. If the
    butter is too soft, the mixture becomes overworked, resulting in a

    The glass pie plates give the flakiest results and are what we
    recommend. Glass also produces a more evenly browned crust. Aluminum
    pans with a dull finish or darkened pans yield a well-baked, tender
    browned under-crust. Shiny metal pie pans reflect the heat and
    result in soggy bottom pie crusts and are not recommended.
  * Common sizes of pie plates are:
      o 9 inches in diameter by 1 inch deep; holds approximately 4.5 cups
      o 10 inches in diameter by 1 inch deep; holds approximately 6 cups

        hard anodized aluminum.
      o Aluminum is light and durable. It is heat sensitive, heating and
        cooling quickly. Since it reacts to acid or alkaline food, it is
        usually coated with stainless steel or a nonstick surface.
      o Stainless steel is durable and nonreactive to acid. It is rust
        resistant and won’t pit. It doesn’t conduct heat very well, so
        is often combined with copper or aluminum as a base layer.
      o Copper is a good heat conductor but it is easily dented and
        tarnishes. It is often used as a base or thin layer in a pan.
      o Cast-iron is heavy. These pans heat slowly and distribute heat
        well. They also rust and need to be seasoned. Some cast iron

  * Waffle irons come in round, square, rectangle and heart shapes
    which can make 1 to 4 waffles.
  * There is also a Belgian waffle maker that makes thicker waffles.
  * Some waffle irons have a flip-over design and a timer just like in a
    restaurant.

*Tips*

  * Read the manual.
  * Look for an iron with a nonstick surface, making it easier for the
    waffles to release. 


        Wax Paper

*Description*

  * Wax paper is a thin sheet of paper that has wax on both sides so it
    is moisture-proof. It is sold in a roll and is used to line cake
    pans for easy removal of cake layers, wrap sandwiches and cover
    foods during microwaving.

*Substitutions*

  * Plastic food storage bags can be used to wrap sandwiches, aluminum
    foil and plastic wrap can also be used wrap food.  Use parchment
    paper to line cake pans.

*Tips*

  * Roll out cookie dough or pie crust between 2 sheets of wax paper.
  * Homemade candy and chocolate dipped nuts, strawberries or pretzels
    won’t stick to wax paper.
  * Place a sheet under a wire cooling rack when frosting and decorating
    cakes, cupcakes and cookies. Drips and sprinkles can be rolled up in
    the wax paper and tossed away, saving cleanup time.


        Whisk

*Description*

  * A wire whisk is made from a series of looped wires fastened at the
    top by a long handle.
  * Whisks are used to whip air into ingredients, such as egg whites or
    whipping cream.
  * The more wires a whisk contains the more effectively it will
    incorporate air into a mixture.
  * Whisks are available in a variety of different sizes for different
    tasks.

*Substitutions*

  * Use a portable electric mixer or wooden spoon.
  * If whisking a very small amount such as one egg white, a fork can be
    used to whip the mixture and incorporate air.


        Wok

*Description*

  * A wok is a large kitchen stovetop pan or a countertop electric
    cooking appliance used to stir fry food. Many woks are nonstick and
    come in various sizes: 12 to 14-inch stovetop woks are the most common. 

*Substitution*

  * A large skillet can be used to stir fry.

*Tip*

  * Steam or braise food in the electric wok.


        Wooden Spoon

*Description*

  * Wooden spoons do not scratch non-stick pans.
  * The bowl end of a wooden spoon is thicker in size than a metal spoon
    of the same size. Therefore it is easier to mix batter because it
    does not cut into the batter but rather stirs or mixes it.
  * Keep a variety of wooden spoons available for baking projects.
  * Always wash and dry wooden spoons after use. Allow them to air dry.

*Substitutions*

  * A large sturdy plastic spoon can be used instead of a wooden spoon.

*Tips*

  * Keep a variety of wooden spoons available for baking projects.
  * Wooden spoons do not scratch non-stick pans.
  * The bowl end of a wooden spoon is thicker in size than a metal spoon
    of the same size. Therefore it is easier to mix batter because it
    does not cut into the batter but rather stirs or mixes it.

        Zester

*Description*

  * A traditional zester is a small kitchen utensil about 4 inches long
    with a curved metal end with small holes.
  *  It is used to remove the zest from citrus fruit. Pressing the
    zester across the fruit removes the zest but not the bitter pith
    underneath the peel. These long threads of zest can then be cut up.
  * Some zesters have a hole at the end which can be used to cut ribbons
    of peel for garnishes and drinks.

*Substitutions*

  * Many small, fine graters will also remove zest from citrus fruit.
    This does not need to be cut up, it is recipe ready.

*Tips*

  * If you are just juicing fruit, remove the zest and freeze.
  * Just like graters, there has been a huge increase in the number of
    specialized zesters.
